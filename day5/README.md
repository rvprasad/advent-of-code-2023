Execute this code via `scala day5.scala <filename>`.

### Observations

1. [Scaladoc](https://docs.scala-lang.org/) is easy to use.
2. VS Code using [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) LSP failed to recognize
   files via their soft links.
3. "Format document" command did not always work with Metals LSP.
