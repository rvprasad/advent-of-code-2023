This repo contains the code to solve the puzzles from [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023).  The README.md file in the folder for each day contains my observations when solving that day's puzzle.

My observations and thoughts about programming and environment from this exercise is available [here](https://rvprasad.medium.com/f1b75e1592a9?source=friends_link&sk=2a196541242647dabfd85a3a196c1c0c).
