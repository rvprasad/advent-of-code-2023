Execute this code via `clj -M -m day6 <filename>`.

### Observations

1. [Clojure Guides](https://clojure-doc.org/) is a good source of info about the language and
   ecosystem.
2. [Your first
   project](https://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/getting_started_cli/)
   describes the simplest bootstrapping for one file project.
3. While _Paredit mode_ in Vim initially seemed unintuitive (compared to
   traditional editing), forcing myself to use it helped with productivity.
