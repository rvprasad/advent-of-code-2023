Execute this code via `clj -M -m day1 <filename>`.

### Observations

1. With prior experience in F# and ML, grokking and using the basic constructs
   of Clojure was very easy.
2. Using _paredit_ mode in Vim for the first time was probably the biggest
   time sink.
3. https://clojuredocs.org/ rocks!
4. Instructions to bootstrap single file programs can be simpler and easier.
