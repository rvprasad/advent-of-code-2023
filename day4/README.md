### Observations

1. Bootstrapping single file programs is a breeze.
2. Documentation is easy to grok.  Docs for 0.16+ seems to be even better.
3. Language is too easy to use :)
4. The pipeline operator plugs the piped value as the first argument in invoked
   function, which is unlike other languages that provide similar operators.
